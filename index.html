            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">The 
            <b>cat (<i>Felis catus</i>)
            </b>
        is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
        It is the only domesticated species in the family  
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae">Felidae
            </a> and is commonly referred to as the 
                <b>domestic cat
                </b> or 
                <b>house cat
                </b> to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill vermin.
